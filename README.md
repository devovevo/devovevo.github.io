## Welcome to DEVO-VEVO!

This website was created as a school project for my AP Computer Science A requirement, and despite its prehistoric look and feel it does serve quite an interesting purpose. Boasting both a metronome and a note recognizer, this site will attempt to generate the notes coming from your microphone if you are playing an instrument.
